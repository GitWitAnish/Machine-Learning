#  Machine Learning — My Ongoing Struggle with Algorithms 
 
This space tracks my progress, experiments, and lessons learned, from the basics to more advanced stuff.

## ⚙️ What’s inside:

-  Supervised learning (I tell the model what to do)  
-  Unsupervised learning (the model pretends to know what it’s doing)  
-  Regression, classification, clustering (a.k.a. *“why is my accuracy so bad?”*)  
-  Model evaluation and tuning (AKA: me staring at confusion matrices wondering where I went wrong)

## 🎯 Why this repo exists:

Just a place where I keep track of what I’m learning, where I mess up, and where I (hopefully) get better over time.  
If future me is reading this: I hope you're better at hyperparameter tuning by now. 🙏
